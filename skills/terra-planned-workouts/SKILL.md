# Terra API Planned Workouts

Push structured workouts directly to your users' fitness devices. Define a workout template once, and the Terra API syncs it to whatever device the user has connected: Garmin, COROS, Wahoo, Suunto, TrainingPeaks, Huawei, Zepp, Hevy, or Apple. This is a write-to-device product, the inverse of the read-focused Terra API Health & Fitness data flow.

> **Pre-release.** This product is pre-release. Endpoints, fields, and provider behavior may change before general availability. Facts here are drawn from the Terra API docs; verify against [docs.tryterra.co/planned-workouts-api](https://docs.tryterra.co/planned-workouts-api) before shipping.

## When to Apply

Reach for this skill when you are:

- Pushing a planned or structured workout to a user's watch or bike computer
- Building reusable workout templates or training plans in an app
- Working with intervals, warmups, cooldowns, and repeat blocks
- Setting HR, power, pace, speed, cadence, RPE, or zone targets
- Personalizing one template per athlete via FTP, max HR, or threshold values
- Handling `coercion_warnings` when a provider cannot represent a feature

## Two-Phase Workflow

Base URL `https://access.tryterra.co/api/v2`. Every request needs two headers: `dev-id` (your Terra developer ID) and `x-api-key` (your Terra API key).

**Phase 1 – Create a template (once).** `POST /workouts` with the workout structure returns a reusable `workout_id`. The template is generic: it holds structure and, where you want personalization, percentage-based targets.

**Phase 2 – Schedule to a user (per athlete).** `POST /workouts/{workout_id}/plan?user_id=X` applies that athlete's parameters (max HR, FTP, etc.) at scheduling time, converts percentage targets to absolute values, and pushes to the connected device. Returns a `planned_workout_id` (Terra API's ID) and a `provider_workout_id` (the device's ID).

```bash
# Phase 1: create a reusable template
curl -X POST "https://access.tryterra.co/api/v2/workouts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "dev-id: YOUR_DEV_ID" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "name": "Threshold Intervals", "sport": "cycling",
        "step_blocks": [{ "completion_condition": {"type":"reps","value":3},
          "steps": [{ "completion_condition": {"type":"time","value":600},
            "intensity_type": "active",
            "intensity_targets": [{"target_type":"power_percentage","value_low":95,"value_high":100}] }] }] }'
# → { "status": "success", "workout_id": "123" }

# Phase 2: apply this athlete's FTP and push to their device
curl -X POST "https://access.tryterra.co/api/v2/workouts/123/plan?user_id=USER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "dev-id: YOUR_DEV_ID" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "planned_date": "2026-02-10", "ftp": 280 }'
# → 201 { "status": "success", "planned_workout_id": "67890", "provider_workout_id": "abc123" }
```

All Terra API IDs (`workout_id`, `planned_workout_id`) are serialized as JSON **strings**, because JavaScript clients lose precision on numbers past 2^53. The `plan` call returns HTTP 201 on success.

## Data Model

A template is a hierarchy: `WorkoutTemplate → step_blocks[] → steps[] → intensity_targets[]`.

**WorkoutTemplate** – `name` (required), `sport` (required), optional `description`, `environment` (`indoor` / `outdoor` / `pool`), and `pool_length_meters` (swimming only). At least one block is required.

**step_blocks[]** – a group of steps executed together. The block's `completion_condition` controls repetition:

| Block condition                    | Behavior                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `{"type":"reps","value":4}`        | Repeat all steps 4 times      |
| `{"type":"time","value":1200}`     | Repeat until 20 minutes total |
| `{"type":"distance","value":5000}` | Repeat until 5 km total       |
| `{"type":"open"}` or omitted       | Execute once (no repeat)      |

**steps[]** – each step needs a `completion_condition` (defaults to `open` if omitted) and an `intensity_type` (required: `warmup`, `active`, `rest`, `recovery`, `cooldown`). Optional: `intensity_targets[]`, `notes`, `strength` (exercise details), `swimming` (stroke and equipment).

Completion condition types: `time` (seconds), `distance` (meters), `reps`, `calories`, `open` (manual lap), `hr_less_than` / `hr_greater_than` (BPM), `power_less_than` / `power_greater_than` (watts).

**intensity_targets[]** – the goal metric for a step. Three families:

- **Absolute** – `heart_rate` (BPM), `power` (watts), `speed` (m/s), `pace` (sec/km), `cadence` (rpm or spm), `rpe` (1-10). No athlete params needed.
- **Percentage** (needs athlete params at scheduling) – `heart_rate_max_percentage` (needs `max_heart_rate`), `heart_rate_threshold_percentage` (needs `threshold_heart_rate`), `power_percentage` (needs `ftp`), `speed_percentage` (needs `threshold_speed`).
- **Zone** – `heart_rate_zone` (1-5), `power_zone` (1-7). Providers convert to their native format.

Target value rules:

- **Absolute targets** accept either a single `value` or a `value_low`/`value_high` range. A single `value` auto-expands to a ±5% range on most providers, **except `rpe`, which stays a point value**.
- **Percentage targets** (`power_percentage`, `heart_rate_max_percentage`, `heart_rate_threshold_percentage`, `speed_percentage`) **reject a single `value` with a 400 at template creation**. Supply `value_low` and/or `value_high`; a lone bound is expanded to a ±5% range.
- Never send both `value` and `value_low`/`value_high` on the same target.
- For ranges, `value_low` must be **strictly less than** `value_high`.
- `pool_length_meters` is swimming-only; setting it elsewhere is invalid.
- Athlete metrics (`ftp`, `max_heart_rate`, `threshold_heart_rate`, `threshold_speed`, `pool_length_meters`) must be positive.
- Sanity ranges are **hard 400 rejections** at `POST /workouts`, not warnings: heart rate 30-250 BPM, power 1-2000 W, speed 0-15 m/s, pace 1-7200 sec/km, cadence 1-300, RPE 1-10, percentage targets 0-200%.

## Athlete Parameters

Templates are generic; personalization happens at scheduling time. Supply these in the `plan` request body:

| Parameter              | Unit   | Used by                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `max_heart_rate`       | BPM    | `heart_rate_max_percentage` targets       |
| `threshold_heart_rate` | BPM    | `heart_rate_threshold_percentage` targets |
| `ftp`                  | watts  | `power_percentage` targets                |
| `threshold_speed`      | m/s    | `speed_percentage` targets                |
| `pool_length_meters`   | meters | swimming (overrides the template value)   |

Conversion is linear: `Absolute = Percentage × param / 100`. A `power_percentage` of 95-100 with `ftp: 280` becomes 266-280 W on the device; the same template scheduled with `ftp: 200` becomes 190-200 W. If a percentage target's required parameter is missing, the Terra API emits a coercion warning and falls back to a provider default rather than failing.

## Coercion Model

Providers differ in what they can represent. When a provider cannot express a feature exactly, the Terra API **adapts the payload, still creates the workout, and returns a `coercion_warnings[]` array**. Each warning is `{ "path": "...", "message": "..." }` pointing at the field that was changed and why.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "planned_workout_id": "12345",
  "provider_workout_id": "garmin_abc123",
  "coercion_warnings": [
    {
      "path": "workout.sport",
      "message": "Unsupported sport type: yoga. Defaulting to OTHER."
    }
  ]
}
```

Coercion is a success path, not an error. How you handle warnings is your choice: log them for debugging, surface a "some features were adjusted for your device" notice to users, or ignore informational ones. Read `references/coercion-scenarios.md` before relying on a feature that may not exist on the target provider.

## Gotchas

- **`DELETE /workouts/{id}` cascades and is irreversible.** It first removes every planned workout linked to that template from every user's device across every provider, then deletes the template. To unschedule one user without touching others, use `DELETE /plannedWorkouts/{id}` instead.
- **`PATCH /plannedWorkouts/{id}` updates only `planned_date`.** It never re-applies athlete parameters. To change targets or params, delete and re-plan.
- **Provider operations differ wildly.** Some providers do not support update, retrieve, or delete. An unsupported operation still returns a success response, so success does not always mean the device changed. Read `references/provider-compatibility.md` before targeting a specific provider.
- **COROS update = delete + recreate.** COROS has no in-place update, so an "update" deletes the old workout and creates a new one; the `provider_workout_id` changes.
- **Huawei is create-only, running-only, no scheduling.** No update, retrieve, or delete on the device. It ignores `planned_date` – the workout is available immediately and **always** returns a coercion warning noting this. Duplicate workout names per user are rejected with a 400. Non-running sports appear as a run.
- **Zepp has a 7-day sync window** (today to today + 6 days). Workouts scheduled outside the window are stored in Terra API's database but not pushed to the device until a later write or delete for that user triggers a window refresh. There is no background auto-sync.
- **Hevy is strength-only.** RPE targets are silently dropped with a warning, there are no block repeats (one block maps to one exercise, one step to one set), and it has no scheduling and no provider-side delete. Updates are supported: when a `provider_workout_id` exists, the existing Hevy routine is updated in place.
- **Apple syncs via the Terra iOS SDK.** The server queues the action; the SDK pushes to WorkoutKit and reports back via `POST /v2/plannedWorkouts/{id}/synced`. Until then `provider_workout_id` is `null`.
- **Garmin retrieve only returns workouts created by your own credentials.** Workouts made by other apps or on the device itself are invisible to your GET calls.
- **Deletes remove from Terra API's database but may leave the workout on the device** for providers without a delete endpoint (e.g. Huawei, Hevy).

## References

Read the reference file that matches your task before writing the request:

- **`references/provider-compatibility.md`** – the full operations matrix (create/update/retrieve/delete per provider) plus each provider's sport, target, completion, and structure support and special behaviors. Read this before targeting a specific provider.
- **`references/coercion-scenarios.md`** – the full catalog of coercion scenarios, handling patterns (log / surface / ignore), and a prevention checklist. Read this before relying on a feature a provider may not support.
- **`references/exercise-reference.md`** – exercise name normalization rules, the Garmin/Hevy flexibility table, and what happens when a name is not found. Read this before building a strength template.

Two things live in the docs rather than this skill, because they are large and change with the API:
