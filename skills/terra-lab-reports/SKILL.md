# Terra Lab Reports Best Practices

Production guidelines and API reference for building with the Terra Lab Reports API (**pre-release**). It converts clinical lab report PDFs and images into structured, standardized biomarker data: OCR plus AI extraction, then fuzzy matching against a reference dataset of ~4,130 biomarkers that yields canonical biomarker keys, UCUM unit codes, and LOINC codes.

**Pre-release: assume the contract may move.** Fetch the live docs pages before generating production request bodies or webhook parsers, and verify against the live API before shipping.

## What the Product Does

Upload a clinical lab report and receive structured biomarker results – extracted, standardized, and delivered to your destinations or available via REST.

- **Input:** one file per request – PDF, PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP, up to 20 MB.
- **Extraction:** OCR plus AI parsing pulls each result's name, value, units, flags, and reference ranges off the page.
- **Standardization:** each extracted name is fuzzy-matched (threshold 0.85) against the ~4,130-entry biomarker dataset, producing a canonical biomarker key, a UCUM-compliant `ucum_code`, and (for ~1,579 of the ~4,130) a `loinc_code`.
- **Output:** a Session containing layered Results (source / biomarker / measurement / interpretation / reference ranges) grouped under report-level Panels, delivered as a `lab_report.completed` event (or `lab_report.failed` on terminal failure).

## Async Workflow and Status Lifecycle

Processing is fully asynchronous. Upload returns immediately with `202` and an **`upload_id`** (`current_status: "processing"`) and the report moves through:

```
processing → processed → standardizing → standardized → sending → sent
```

Other statuses: `retry_scheduled`, `retrying`, `cancelled`, `deleted`, and `failed`. Terminal states are `sent`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `deleted`.

**Results are queryable once the session reaches `standardized`** – before delivery. You do not have to wait for `sent` to read them. Learn the outcome via the webhook events (`lab_report.completed` on success, `lab_report.failed` on terminal failure) or by polling. Processing typically takes 30 seconds to 3 minutes.

## Endpoints

Base URL `https://access.tryterra.co/api`. Every request needs both headers: `dev-id` and `x-api-key`.

| Method | Endpoint                                     | Notes                                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/v2/lab-reports`                            | Multipart upload; field MUST be `file` (singular), one file/request. `202` returns `upload_id` + `current_status: "processing"` – NO session_id (one upload can fan out to several sessions). |
| GET    | `/v2/lab-reports`                            | List / filter (by `reference_id`, `upload_id`, `report_date_from`/`_to`, `uploaded_at_from`/`_to`). Capped at 500 – use filters. |
| GET    | `/v2/lab-reports/{session_id}`               | Session: metadata, `upload_id`, status history, layered `results[]`, `panels[]`. Files, artifacts, and delivery state are NOT embedded – use the sub-resources. |
| GET    | `/v2/lab-reports/{session_id}/files`         | Input files + thumbnail as presigned URLs, with a response-level `expires_at`. |
| GET    | `/v2/lab-reports/{session_id}/deliveries`    | Per-destination delivery state (`destination_id`, `status`, `attempt_count`, `last_error`). |
| GET    | `/v2/lab-reports/{session_id}/artifacts`     | Processing artifacts; privileged keys only – standard keys get `404`. |
| POST   | `/v2/lab-reports/{session_id}/reprocess`     | Re-run extraction/standardization; async `202`. Emits a NEW event (new `event_id`) with the SAME `session_id`. |
| DELETE | `/v2/lab-reports/{session_id}`               | Soft-delete; `204`.                                              |

[references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md) routes each goal to its endpoint and notes the semantics the spec page treats lightly; read it before implementing any endpoint call.

## Data Model

A hierarchy: **Session → Results[] + Panels[]**, where each Result is layered.

- **Session** – `session_id` (snowflake string), `upload_id`, optional `reference_id`, `current_status`, `report_type`, report/collection dates and times, `report_locale`, `lab_name`, `patient_sex`, `patient_age_at_collection`, `status_history[]`, `results_count`, `file_count`, `input_bytes`, `output_bytes`, `report_notes`, `results[]`, `panels[]`.
- **Panel** – report-level grouping: `{ id, name, key }`. Results reference it via `biomarker.panel_id`.
- **Result** – four layers, identical between the webhook payload and GET:
  - `source` – what the report literally printed: `name`, `panel`, `value` (raw string), `units`, `flag` (verbatim), `method`, `notes`, `reference_text` (plus `collection_date`/`collection_time` on the webhook copy only – GET carries those on the session).
  - `biomarker` – normalized identity: `key` (**null when unmatched**), `display_name`, `loinc_code`, `panel_id`, `panel_key`, `specimen`.
  - `measurement` – one typed value: `type` names the populated sibling (`numeric`, `bounded` `{operator, value}`, `qualitative` `{text, code}`, `text`, or absent with `absent_reason`), plus `units` and `ucum_code`.
  - `interpretation` – the abnormality layer: `flag` (coded, nullable), `flag_raw`, `source`, `applied_range` `{lower, upper}` (the range the flag was judged against).
- **Reference Range** – `lower`, `upper`, `type` (a range-type label describing the range, not a verdict), and a `context` (`sex`, `age_lower`/`age_upper`, `pregnancy_status`, `cycle_phase`, `gestational_week_lower`/`_upper`, `reference_population`, `modifiers[]`).

Webhook envelope semantics are in [references/webhook-payload.md](references/webhook-payload.md); for field-level types and the enum tables (which are open and grow over time), fetch the live [Core Concepts](https://docs.tryterra.co/lab-reports/core-concepts) page (append `.md` for markdown).

### Key Data Semantics

- **`biomarker.key` is present-but-NULL when unmatched** – it is the sole no-match signal. Never key off `loinc_code` (it can be null even on a match). Fall back to `source.name` / `biomarker.display_name` and keep the result.
- **Branch on `measurement.type` and read the matching field.** Do not probe multiple value fields in priority order – the flat `value` / `value_gt` / `value_lt` / `qualitative_value` fields no longer exist; a bound like `<0.5` arrives as `bounded: { "operator": "lt", "value": 0.5 }`.
- **Two flags, two meanings.** `source.flag` is the raw lab string (`"H"`, `"↑"`, ...); `interpretation.flag` is the coded signal (nullable – null means no signal), with `flag_raw` echoing the verbatim form and `source` naming its provenance.
- **Enums are open.** `current_status`, `report_type`, `measurement.type`, `specimen`, range `type`, `patient_sex` may gain new values without a major version bump. Handle unknowns gracefully (default/unknown category, never throw).
- All enum values are clean lowercase strings (`"sent"`, not `"REPORT_STATUS_SENT"` or `6`). All timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC.

## Gotchas

- **Upload returns `upload_id`, NOT `session_id`.** The `202` body is `{ "upload_id": "...", "current_status": "processing" }`. One upload can fan out to several sessions; learn session IDs from the webhook's `data.session_id` or `GET /v2/lab-reports?upload_id=...`. `upload_id` can be absent on older sessions – treat it as optional.
- **Two webhook events; branch on the envelope `type`.** `lab_report.completed` on success, `lab_report.failed` on terminal failure. Per-destination opt-in still uses the single coarse type `"lab_report"` in `destination_event_types` – both events share it.
- **Dedupe on `event_id`.** Redeliveries of the same stored payload carry the SAME `event_id`; a reprocess is a new event with a NEW `event_id` and the SAME `session_id`. See rules/webhooks-dedupe-event-id.md.
- **Failures carry a structured error.** `data.error` is `{ code, message, retriable }` with codes `file_unreadable`, `extraction_failed`, `standardization_failed`, `internal`. `retriable: true` means the same input may succeed on re-submission; `false` means fix the input first.
- **`interpretation.applied_range` can be null while `reference_ranges` are populated.** It is only set when exactly one range unambiguously applies to the patient; when it is null, filter `reference_ranges` by context yourself (see rules/data-filter-ranges-by-demographics.md).
- **Presigned file URLs live on sub-resources and expire.** `GET .../files` (and privileged `.../artifacts`) return presigned URLs with a response-level `expires_at` (roughly one hour out). They are not embedded in the webhook or the session response. Re-mint by re-fetching the sub-resource; do not persist a URL past its `expires_at`.
- **Artifacts are privileged-only, as a `404`.** Standard keys get `404` from `GET .../artifacts`, not an empty list.
- **Oversize uploads:** a file over 20 MB is normally rejected with `400` ("invalid multipart form or file too large") via the byte-limit reader; a `413` only fires when the multipart part declares a Content-Length over the cap. Expect `400` (sometimes `413`).

## Rules

Read the relevant rule in `rules/` before writing that code. Each is a standalone file with incorrect/correct examples.

### Webhooks & Delivery (HIGH)

- `webhooks-dedupe-event-id` – Key idempotency on `event_id`; redeliveries reuse it, a reprocess mints a new one with the same `session_id`.
- `api-poll-at-most-every-5s` – Webhooks for production (success AND failure events); polling for dev/fallback; poll no faster than every 5 seconds and stop on a terminal status.

### Data Handling & API Usage (HIGH–MEDIUM)

- `data-keep-unmatched-biomarkers` – A null `biomarker.key` is clinically relevant; never discard the result, fall back to `source.name` and flag for review.
- `data-filter-ranges-by-demographics` – Use `interpretation.applied_range` when present; otherwise filter `reference_ranges` by sex/age/context before interpreting; handle `measurement.bounded` conservatively.
- `data-store-ids-as-strings` – Snowflake `session_id`s lose precision as JS numbers; keep them strings end to end.
- `data-parse-utf8` – Data contains `µ`, `×`, `±`, superscripts; always parse as UTF-8.
- `api-space-bulk-uploads` – One file per request, 20 MB cap, 30s–3min each; space bulk uploads and tag with `reference_id`.
